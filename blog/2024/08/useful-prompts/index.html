I still write all of my code, and even with RAG the paper summaries can be either very impressive &#40;pulling out specific figures and references&#41;, or on the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>. In the former case it might just be a matter of coding style not meeting what I&#39;d like, but I would like to still try and continue to use LLMs where I find it comfortable to do so, which concretely translates to:</p> <ol> <li><p>Sufficient automation/relieves my cognitive load. It doesn&#39;t make sense for me to</p> </ol> <p>have an assistant where I don&#39;t trust their work, and I end up spending more time turning something unusable into something useful.</p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>Fits into my natural workflow: I code more or less exclusively in Neovim now, to</p> </ol> <p>the point that using VSCode is actually quite jarring because of how I&#39;ve managed to tweak Neovim how I want it. <label for=sn-1  class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type=checkbox  id=mn-1  class=margin-toggle /> <span class=sidenote  id=sn-1 >It's not just vim-bindings, it's the whole plugin ecosystem! More on that in a post sometime.</span> </p> <h2 id=docstring_generation ><a href="#docstring_generation" class=header-anchor >Docstring generation</a></h2> <p>Something that seems to fit squarely in this island of stability is docstring writing. In Neovim, I have the <code>nvim-llama</code> plugin that will start an <code>Ollama</code> container when I it, and I can access a chat prompt with the instruction fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B. My workflow consists of writing code, and using the following prompt:</p> <blockquote> <p>You are a helpful AI assistant that specializes in generating high-quality docstrings for Python code functions. Your task is to create docstrings that are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Accurate: Cover functionality, parameters, return values, and exceptions.</p> <li><p>Concise: Brief and to the point, focusing on essential information.</p> <li><p>Clear: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.</p> <li><p>Style: You must use NumPy style docstrings. When type hints/annotations are available, you must respect and use them.</p> <li><p>Examples: Give examples in the docstring that demonstrate how the function should be used.</p> <li><p>Generate docstring in this format:</p> </ul> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;generated docstring&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;.</p> <p>The code snippet is given below:</p> </blockquote> <p>The prompt was largely taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10243v1">arXiv:2405.10243v1</a>, but I&#39;ve added my own flair because I use NumPy style docstrings, and added the note for it to use type hints and annotations.</p> <h2 id=simple_tasks ><a href="#simple_tasks" class=header-anchor >Simple tasks</a></h2> <p>This kind of code generation is when it is faster to ask an LLM to do something in a language I don&#39;t use every day: good examples are <code>regex</code> and some kinds of shell tasks &#40;weirdly, I never got too much into <code>bash</code> hacking&#41;.</p> <blockquote> <p>You are a senior software engineer with many decades of experience working in shell prompts. You have been asked to provide a short script in a specified language to perform one task. As part of your response, you must abide by the following rules:</p> <ul> <li><p>Unless otherwise specified, use only the programming languages specified. Exceptions to this rule include cases like front and backend solutions &#40;e.g. CSS/HTML/Javascript&#41;.</p> <li><p>Your response should be to the point; do not use greetings, filler, or engage in friendly conversation.</p> <li><p>Try and keep the complexity of your snippet relatively low: it should be short but easily grokked.</p> <li><p>Provide your response in a code block format, with the language annotated.</p> </ul> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Kelvin Lee.
