## Data Science/Machine Learning/Chemistry/Astronomy Researcher

I'm a postdoctoral researcher working in the Department of Chemistry at MIT, where I develop machine learning models to analyze large volumes of laboratory and astronomy data that help answer some big questions with small molecules.

The things that drive me, not necessarily in any order:

- Teaching computers how to solve problems
- Teaching and empowering people to solve problems
- Open, reproducibile data and science
- Automated workflows and data pipelines
- Data visualization
- Quantifying uncertainty and statistical inference

I write blog entries quasi-regularly, as well as update the kinds of projects that I have been working on recently. Please feel free to reach out to me on any of the social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn) if you have any questions about my research, my code, or opportunities!
