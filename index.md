If you're looking for Kelvin, he's right here!

This is my personal website and blog; you can think of it as a portal into the different areas of my work and life.

Here are some things that may interest you:

- My [Github repo](https://www.github.com/laserkelvin).
- My [Zettelkasten](https://laserkelvin.github.io/ml-reviews) for machine learning; something like a second brain to organize reading the literature.
- For more distilled/organized thoughts, my [blog](/blog/).\sidenote{lol}{Eventually!}
- My [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cB90fKUAAAAJ&hl=en).

The theme of this website is customized from [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), based on [Butterick's Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/). Both are big sources of inspiration for all my visual design elements!
