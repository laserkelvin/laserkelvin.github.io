Predicting what molecule to look for next is a difficult thing to do when chemical and physical conditions of interstellar environments can potentially be highly complex. In this project, I build a machine learning pipeline for predicting molecular properties by leveraging cheminformatics and data science tools to predict and direct astronomical observations and laboratory experiments.
