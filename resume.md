Professional Experience
--------------------

Since Feb 2017
:   ### Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian—Cambridge, MA
    _Postdoctoral Research Fellow_

    - Developed machine learning models and open-source frameworks for automated spectroscopic analysis and molecule discovery in space and in the laboratory; workflow reduced analysis time from months to weeks.
    - [Co-authored 16 publications; six as lead author](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cB90fKUAAAAJ&hl=en), one as project leader, and remainder as part of large teams.
    - Lead successful grant proposals as co-investigator from the Smithsonian Institution, National Science Foundation, and NASA; _raised over $500,000 USD_ in public funding.
    - Mentored early career researchers on scientific and numerical Python, and reproducible workflows.
    - Reviewed new research articles in major publications: role as referee/reviewer on 13 manuscripts.

Aug 2016‒Feb 2017
:   ### University of New South Wales—Sydney, Australia
    _Postdoctoral Research Fellow_

    - Researched photochemistry of atmospheric molecules; destruction of pollutants under UV irradiation by lasers.
    - Lead the experiments, analysis, and dissemination of multiple research projects through peer-reviewed publications and oral presentations at international conferences.
    - Published five publications in major peer-reviewed journals; three as lead author.
    - Mentored undergraduate students on various theoretical and experimental research projects.
    - Developed open-source tools for automated analysis of ion images and trajectory simulations.
    - High accuracy quantum chemical calculations of photolytic reactions of pollutants; quasi-classical trajectory simulations of how molecules dissociate.

Selected Open-source Contributions
-------------------------

Python
:   [PySpecTools](https://laserkelvin.github.io/PySpecTools/) is a library I
    developed to help analyze broadband spectral data with an emphasis on
    reproducibility and collaboration.
