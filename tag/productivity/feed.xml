    <![CDATA[  <h1 id="fill_title">Handy language model prompts for productivity</h1>
<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been increasingly using language models to help automate some of the nitty gritty stuff, including setting up a workflow for <a href="https://laserkelvin.github.io/research-paper-summaries">automating paper summarization</a>, and <em>some</em> assistance with misc. coding and productivity tasks.</p>
<p>While the models that can be served on a client CPU/GPU have substantially improved in the last two years, I&#39;ve found that they&#39;re still not quite at the point where they are reliable enough for me to pass more critical tasks. I still write all of my code, and even with RAG the paper summaries can be either very impressive &#40;pulling out specific figures and references&#41;, or on the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>. In the former case it might just be a matter of coding style not meeting what I&#39;d like, but I would like to still try and continue to use LLMs where I find it comfortable to do so, which concretely translates to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sufficient automation/relieves my cognitive load. It doesn&#39;t make sense for me to have an assistant where I don&#39;t trust their work, and I end up spending more time turning something unusable into something useful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fits into my natural workflow: I code more or less exclusively in Neovim now, to the point that using VSCode is actually quite jarring because of how I&#39;ve managed to tweak Neovim how I want it.
    <label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote" id="sn-1">It's not just vim-bindings, it's the whole plugin ecosystem! More on that in a post sometime.</span>
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="docstring_generation">Docstring generation</h2>
<p>Something that seems to fit squarely in this island of stability is docstring writing. In Neovim, I have the <code>nvim-llama</code> plugin that will start an <code>Ollama</code> container when I it, and I can access a chat prompt with the instruction fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B. My workflow consists of writing code, and using the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a helpful AI assistant that specializes in generating high-quality docstrings for Python code functions.  Your task is to create docstrings that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accurate: Cover functionality, parameters, return values, and exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concise: Brief and to the point, focusing on essential information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clear: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Style: You must use NumPy style docstrings. When type hints/annotations are available, you must respect and use them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Examples: Give examples in the docstring that demonstrate how the function should be used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generate docstring in this format:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;generated docstring&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;.</p>
<p>The code snippet is given below:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prompt was largely taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.10243v1">arXiv:2405.10243v1</a>, but I&#39;ve added my own flair because I use NumPy style docstrings, and added the note for it to use type hints and annotations.</p>
<h2 id="simple_tasks">Simple tasks</h2>
<p>This kind of code generation is when it is faster to ask an LLM to do something in a language I don&#39;t use every day: good examples are <code>regex</code> and some kinds of shell tasks &#40;weirdly, I never got too much into <code>bash</code> hacking&#41;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a senior software engineer with many decades of experience working in shell prompts. You have been asked to provide a short script in a specified language to perform one task. As part of your response, you must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unless otherwise specified, use only the programming languages specified. Exceptions to this rule include cases like front and backend solutions &#40;e.g. CSS/HTML/Javascript&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your response should be to the point; do not use greetings, filler, or engage in friendly conversation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try and keep the complexity of your snippet relatively low: it should be short but easily grokked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide your response in a code block format, with the language annotated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

    <![CDATA[  <h1 id="fill_title">Things to live by in 2024</h1>
<p>This past Christmas and new year season has been the most restful for me in recent memory: coming off the backside of the pandemic, making a career change, and moving across the country has occupied me the last few years. In this time, I&#39;ve been trying to take better care of myself, seeing the doctor, etc. on things that have been bothering me but I&#39;ve been putting off.</p>
<p>During this time, I&#39;ve been reading a lot of essays that get shared on Hacker News that I&#39;ve been finding quite insightful and inspiring. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uGDtroD26aLvHSoK2/dear-self-we-need-to-talk-about-ambition-1">One in particular</a> was written in the form of a letter to their younger self with a lot of advice and introspection that I found extremely relatable, and partly inspired me to write this up; instead of a letter to my past self&mdash;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite there yet&mdash;I thought I would write this up in the spirit of new year&#39;s resolutions, and serve to remind myself of more mindful times as the year inevitably picks up.</p>
<p>Without further ado, <em>things to live by in 2024</em>.</p>
<h2 id="look_after_yourself">Look after yourself</h2>
<p>If it hurts, take the time to make it better for yourself. &#40;Un&#41;fortunately, you&#39;re at an age now where your health&mdash;for better or worse&mdash;takes compound interest and your current state will propagate years down the line. When you were younger, you could brush stress, anxiety, and pain off and bounce back, but things like bad ergonomics are going to ruin you down the line if you&#39;re not careful. Do your best to exercise every day, take your Vitamin D, and fix your posture. It&#39;s not all that bad.</p>
<h2 id="spend_more_time_on_the_foundational_not_the_sensational">Spend more time on the foundational, not the sensational</h2>
<p>FOMO has been the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to stress and anxiety; you work in a fast moving field and there&#39;s just absolutely no way anybody can remain up to date with everything new that comes out. This includes reading new papers, and <em>especially</em> getting force fed by recommendation engines &#40;you&#39;re probably doom scrolling your Google feed&#41;. Cool new research, libraries, and &quot;stuff&quot; pop up at an hourly rate, and balancing between what you do for your job, your own personal interests, and your sanity, it&#39;s probably better for you to focus on moving averages as opposed to individual data points.
    <label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote" id="sn-1">\href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38829907}{This discussion} was particularly inspiring.</span>
     In other words, the vast majority of what you read about in 2024 are likely going to be one-off things, so try and look for things that are going to be here to stay and spend your time and effort there. <em>You&#39;ll always have more ideas than time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="its_okay_if_things_go_slowly_dont_go_to_plan_or_even_spiral_out_of_control">It&#39;s okay if things go slowly, don&#39;t go to plan, or even spiral out of control</h2>
<p>We do things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy.
    <label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote" id="sn-2">I have no idea who to attribute this to, but evidently it's a mutation of JFK's Moon speech. Whoever it was, they were pretty cynical.</span>
     Consequently, things are inevitably going to be harder and take longer than you originally thought; <em>that&#39;s perfectly fine</em> and just be patient with yourself. It&#39;s okay to reduce the scope of things, and it&#39;s okay to not know how everything will pan out from the get go: if rules were made to be broken, then plans are made to go wrong. If there&#39;s one thing academia taught you is that projects&mdash;<em>actually your whole damn year</em>&mdash;will rarely go the way you thought it will. </p>
<p><a href="https://peoplelogic.ai/blog/history-of-objectives-and-key-results">OKRs</a> are good and all, but like all other models, it works for some things &#40;e.g. business targets&#41; and not others &#40;e.g. long term, dynamic projects&#41;. You can easily spend all of your time trying to meticulously craft OKRs to ensure you have the right scope, the right degree of ambition, but KRs and objectives can come crashing down when circumstances inevitably change. <em>Life finds a way</em>, so be fluid and be flexible.</p>
